When working on a song, please follow these guidelines:
- Always make sure to have the latest version of the project before you do anything. I try to merge open PRs asap.
- You can save the project in either .mmp or .mmpz format as long as it's compatible with the latest stable release.
- Only use instruments/effects that are included in LMMS, unless we agree otherwise.
- We strongly suggest not to use any external samples or soundfonts. But if you really want to do so, please edit the project file to use relative paths so it will work everywhere.
- Please don't use global automations or such black-magic. It's better for everyone.
