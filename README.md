# LMMS collaboration repository
Trying to create a musical collaboration platform in a way nobody did before.

If you are an LMMS user and you want to work together with other LMMS users, then this is the place for you.

The project is based completely on raw trust, the repository owner takes no responsiblity for anything you do here.

Please carefully read our contributing guidelines.

Let's make music!
